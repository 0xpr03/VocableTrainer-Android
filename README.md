## FAQ
- Docs ?!  
  [Docs!](https://github.com/0xpr03/VocableTrainer-Android/wiki)
- What about these internet permissions?!
  These are used only to take part in an opt-in android-api-version survey.  
- What about a localisation for X ?  
  I would appreciate a PR for localizations.
- Playstore version  
  Google wants money for publishing a free app, so if you want to see a playstore release, you can donate for that.
- The latest release is not on f-droid.  
  Please wait for f-droids build process to catch up.
- What is this first `1.0` version before `0.1` about ?  
  Default values weren't changed. It is therefore "0.0"

## Distribution

Please always link to the f-droid repository, I won't give any support for unofficial builds.
